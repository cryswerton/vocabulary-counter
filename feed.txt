The entire Naruto fandom has been worried about his potential death since the Boruto manga began, but we never stopped to think about Kurama’s, and that’s precisely what has happened.

Naruto’s partner, Kurama – the Nine-tailed fox, died in chapter 55 of the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations manga due to the excessive use of chakra when Naruto and Kurama used Baryon mode against Isshiki Ohtsutsuki.

Chapter 55 starts with Naruto and Kurama having a chat in the former’s subconscious mind – while Naruto thinks that he has died, Kurama informs him that his time hasn’t come yet. However, the same can not be said for the Kyuubi himself. Naruto is shocked and utterly devastated by Kurama’s implication. His worries come true when Kurama tells him about the lie.

“The Baryon mode’s price is my life. Not yours, Naruto.”

Holding back my tears and the urge to throw my phone away, I continued reading as Kurama explained his reasons for the lie.

“Just so you know, I never once lied to you. At no time did I ever say that you would die. If I’d told you at the get-go that power came in exchange for my life, you would’ve hesitated.”

Unfortunately, I agree. If Naruto knew that his partner might die, he would’ve never used the Baryon mode, and in turn, everyone, including Sasuke, Boruto, Kawaki, and Kurama, might have died.

The final panel of the chapter also shows another vessel for Isshiki – Code. This means that not only did Kurama die and Sasuke lose his Rinnegan, but Isshiki is still alive and well!

What does Kurama’s death mean for Naruto’s power level?
For obvious reasons, Kurama’s death has had a HUGE impact on not only Naruto’s power level but on the entire shinobi world itself. Naruto’s status as the “War Hero” and “The Strongest Shinobi” established the peace we now see in Boruto.

Remember the time when the five major villages were established?

The First Hokage, Hashirama Senju, was so strong that he singlehandedly captured all nine-tailed beasts, literally donated them to other villages, and kept the power balance, and everyone agreed to his policies. However, things started to change after his death. During the era of Tobirama Senju, distrust began to rise even among the clans belonging to the same hidden village.

The same is likely to happen if the news about Naruto’s loss gets out. While we are yet to see how strong Naruto is now, it is safe to say that he’s not the strongest shinobi anymore. However, the status can change if Naruto were to master his sage mode and the Yin Yang chakra bestowed upon him by Hagoromo Ohtsutsuki. OR if Kurama returns.

I know…I know what you are thinking. Can Kurama still return? Well, yes and no. Let’s find out.

Is Kurama really dead? Can he be revived?
Much to my dismay, Naruto’s shinobi world still does not have the dragon balls yet! (Shucks!!!) Even though Shenron cannot help us out this time, someone equally big can. When I was trying to think about whether Kurama will come back or not, yesn’t was my conclusion. Let me explain…

Kurama and the other eight tailed beasts were initially created by Hagoromo Ohtsutsuki when he split the chakra of ten tails after defeating the colossal beast. In Boruto, we have another ten-tails waiting around and sucking Earth’s chakra to become the god tree and bear the Chakra Fruit.

With Naruto and Sasuke having Yin Yang chakra and their mastery of sage mode, they can cut the ten tails and divide it into some tailed beasts again. Although the new beast will likely have a different personality than our beloved Kyuubi, at this point, I will take what I can get!

Now that I have explained how Kurama can come back, we need to address whether he will or not. The short answer is that Kurama won’t come back to life or be revived from another ten-tails.

Since the beginning of the manga, the plot has revolved around keeping Bourto and Kawaki as the new protagonist duo – in order to do that, Sasuke and Naruto were likely to get nerfed sooner or later. And because of this, I am certain that Kurama is not coming back.

Here’s to Kurama, the world’s best partner, who stuck with Naruto and all of us since its first appearance in 1999. Goodbye, old friend. You will be missed. 🙁

Ps…another way is if Amado manages to successfully clone Kurama and put it back into Naruto.
